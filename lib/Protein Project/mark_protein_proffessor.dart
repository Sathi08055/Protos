# Biochemistry

Let’s go beneath the surface—beyond food labels, beyond muscle growth—and into the **molecular machinery** that makes proteins the most versatile molecules in biology. This is biochemistry: the level where amino acids aren’t just building blocks, they’re **dynamic actors** in cellular conversations.

Here, we explore how proteins are **synthesized, folded, broken down**, and recycled. You’ll learn how **enzyme systems**, **cofactors**, and **metabolic networks** manage amino acids with surgical precision. It’s not about what proteins _do for you_—it’s about how your body builds and deploys them with stunning efficiency.

## Amino Acid

Let’s get molecular. Every amino acid—the building block of protein—shares a core structure: a **central (α) carbon** bonded to four distinct groups:

- An **amino group** (–NH₂)
- A **carboxyl group** (–COOH)
- A **hydrogen atom**
- And the game-changer: a unique **R group**, also called the **side chain**

![](assets/protein/IMG-20250704210814851.png)

This side chain gives each amino acid its own personality—some are sweet and neutral, others are acidic, basic, or polar. These little differences control how amino acids interact and fold into functional proteins.

Here’s a fun fact: all amino acids (except **glycine**) have a **chiral α-carbon**, meaning they exist in mirror-image forms. But nature plays favorites—we only use the **L-form** in our bodies. Sorry, D-form.

## Bonds and Structures

When amino acids link up, they form **peptide bonds**—a covalent connection made through a **condensation reaction** (aka dehydration), where water is released. It’s molecular Velcro, but stronger.

From here, proteins take on multiple levels of structure:

- **Primary Structure**: A straight-up sequence of amino acids. No folding, just order.
![](assets/protein/IMG-20250704210859377.png)
- **Secondary Structure**: Local shapes—**α-helices** and **β-sheets**—held together by hydrogen bonds. This is where your protein starts to show style.
![](assets/protein/IMG-20250704211002394.png)

- **Tertiary Structure**: Now we’re talking full 3D. Interactions between side chains shape the final folded structure.
![](assets/protein/IMG-20250704211027214.png)
- **Quaternary Structure**: Some proteins get social—multiple chains (subunits) come together to form one functional complex.
![](assets/protein/IMG-20250704211117587.png)

Each level matters. A change in one amino acid can disrupt the entire protein. (Looking at you, sickle cell hemoglobin.)
## Synthesis and Degradation

Proteins aren’t static—they’re constantly being built, broken, and recycled. Let’s dive into the two sides of the equation:

### A. 🏗️ Synthesis (Biosynthesis)

Your body is a master of recycling and repurposing. Most amino acids are made by **transamination**, where an amino group is transferred—usually from **glutamate**—to a keto acid. The reaction is catalyzed by **aminotransferases**, with **pyridoxal phosphate (PLP)** as a cofactor.

Glutamate isn’t just a flavor enhancer—it’s a central hub in amino acid metabolism. It’s used to make **glutamine, proline, and arginine**, among others. The core carbon skeletons come from intermediates of glycolysis and the TCA cycle.

---

### B. 🧨 Degradation (Catabolism)

When amino acids aren’t needed—or are being recycled—their breakdown begins with **transamination** again, transferring the amino group to **α-ketoglutarate**, forming **glutamate**.

From there:

- **Glutamate** undergoes **oxidative deamination**, releasing free ammonia (NH₃) and regenerating α-ketoglutarate.
- That toxic ammonia is then sent off to the **urea cycle** for safe disposal.

But the **carbon skeletons** stick around and enter different energy pathways depending on their type:
- **Glucogenic amino acids** → feed into **gluconeogenesis** via pyruvate or TCA cycle intermediates
- **Ketogenic amino acids** → become **acetyl-CoA** or **acetoacetyl-CoA**, leading to ketone bodies or ATP.
- Some amino acids are **dual-purpose**, acting as both glucogenic and ketogenic

---

### 🔄 Integration with Metabolism

Amino acid metabolism doesn’t operate in isolation—it’s woven into your entire metabolic web:

- **TCA Cycle**: Feeds carbon skeletons for energy
   
- **Urea Cycle**: Detoxifies excess nitrogen
   
- **Gluconeogenesis & Ketogenesis**: Supports fasting and energy balance

- **Immune Function**: Rapidly dividing cells (like T-cells) rely on dynamic amino acid availability to grow, signal, and fight
   
Even the **mitochondria** in your cells act as miniature factories—producing and breaking down amino acids as needed, especially when energy demand spikes.

**Side Note** : The cycles mentioned above are worthy enough to dedicate a separate section (But not in this app). So If you want to feed your mind with more knowledge, go check them out on Google or YouTube.

# Physical Properties of Protein

Understanding proteins at the molecular level isn’t just about what they _do_—it’s about how they _behave_. From their shape to how they respond to light, pH, and temperature, proteins are incredibly nuanced. Let’s break down the key properties that define how these molecules exist and function in real biological systems.

---

## 🎨 1. Colour

In their pure form, proteins are typically **colourless**. Any visible colour usually comes from **prosthetic groups**—non-protein components that attach to the main structure. For example, the rich red of hemoglobin is thanks to its **heme group**, not the protein itself.

---

## 🔵 2. Shape

Proteins come in two major forms:

- **Globular proteins**: Compact, spherical, and usually **soluble in water**. Most enzymes and transport proteins fall into this category.
    
- **Fibrillar proteins**: Long, fiber-like structures, generally **insoluble** and **structural** (e.g., collagen, keratin).
    

Shape is not just cosmetic—it determines **function, solubility, and stability**.

---

## ⚖️ 3. Size (Molecular Weight)

Protein size is measured in kilodaltons (**kDa**) and can vary widely:

- **Small peptides**: ~5 kDa
    
- **Most functional proteins**: 35–70 kDa
    
- **Giant complexes**: Over 1 megaDalton (MDa)
    

Size affects everything from diffusion rates to how easily a protein can be studied or absorbed.

---

## 💧 4. Solubility

Protein solubility isn’t fixed—it changes with **pH, salt concentration**, and **temperature**.

- At the **isoelectric point (pI)**, proteins carry no net charge and are least soluble.
    
- Move above or below that pH, and they gain charge, improving solubility.
    
- Denature a protein, and solubility tanks—structure matters.
    

---

## 👅 5. Taste

Pure proteins are generally **tasteless or bland**. However, when proteins are **hydrolyzed** (broken into smaller peptides), they can develop a **bitter** taste—especially in processed protein products or supplements.

---

## 👃 6. Odour

Proteins themselves are **odourless**. Any smell typically comes from degradation (think spoiled meat) or from attached molecules, such as sulfur-containing side chains. These are the culprits behind that “eggy” scent in boiled proteins.

---

## 🌈 7. Optical Activity

Proteins are **optically active**, meaning they rotate plane-polarised light—usually to the **left** (levorotatory). This is due to the **chiral nature** of L-amino acids in their structure. The exact degree of rotation depends on the amino acid composition and the protein's conformation.

---

## ⚖️ 8. Amphoteric Nature

Proteins are **amphoteric**—they can act as both **acids and bases**. Depending on the pH of their environment, they either donate or accept protons (H⁺), which also determines their **electric charge** and **behavior in electrophoresis**. Each protein has a **unique isoelectric point (pI)** where it has no net charge.

---

## 🌫️ 9. Colloidal Nature

In solution, proteins behave as **colloids**—large molecules dispersed in liquid. They **diffuse slowly**, scatter light (Tyndall effect), and don’t easily settle out. This is due to their large size and water-binding properties, giving protein solutions a characteristic cloudy appearance.

---

## 🔥 10. Denaturation

Heat, extreme pH, solvents, or chemicals like **urea** can unravel a protein’s structure—this is **denaturation**. It disrupts secondary and tertiary structures, leading to **loss of biological activity** and **precipitation** in many cases. The primary sequence, however, usually remains intact.

---

## 🌡️ 11. Thermal Stability

Not all proteins handle heat equally:

- **Albumin** starts denaturing at ~60 °C
    
- **Ribonuclease**, on the other hand, resists up to ~90 °C
    

Thermal stability is determined by **intramolecular bonds** and **folding**. Proteins adapted to high-temperature environments (like thermophilic bacteria) can be remarkably heat-stable.

---

## ⚡ 12. Electrical Charge

A protein’s **net charge** depends on the surrounding **pH**.

- Below its isoelectric point → **positively charged**
    
- Above it → **negatively charged**
    

This affects solubility, binding, and how proteins behave in techniques like **electrophoresis**.

---

## 💧 13. Hydration Properties

Proteins **attract and bind water molecules**—especially around **charged and polar side chains**. This **hydration shell** stabilizes structure, affects solubility, and is key to protein behavior in biological fluids and food systems.

# Chemical Properties of Protein

## 1. **Hydrolysis** – Breaking It Down

Proteins can be **cleaved into peptides and amino acids** through **acid, base, or enzymatic** hydrolysis. Enzymes like **pepsin and trypsin** target specific bonds to aid digestion, while full hydrolysis yields **individual amino acids**, the endgame of protein breakdown.

---

## 2. **Peptide Bond Reactions** – The Core Connection

**Peptide bonds** (C–N linkages) form via **condensation** reactions—water is removed to link amino acids. These same bonds are **broken by hydrolysis**, making this reaction essential for both **protein synthesis and degradation**. It’s the fundamental “on/off” switch of protein structure.

---

## 3. **Denaturation by Chemical Agents**

Unlike hydrolysis, **denaturation** doesn’t break peptide bonds—it just **unfolds** the protein. Strong **acids, bases, detergents, heavy metals**, and organic solvents disrupt hydrogen bonds and **disulfide bridges**, leading to **loss of structure and function**. The protein’s still technically whole—it’s just not doing its job anymore.

---

## 4. **Reaction with Acids & Bases**

When proteins meet **strong acids (like HCl or H₂SO₄)** or **strong bases**, their ionic bonds get disrupted. This can cause **coagulation or precipitation**—as seen in classic tests like **Heller’s test**, where proteins visibly clump under acidic stress.

---

## 5. **Oxidation & Reduction Reactions**

Proteins contain side chains vulnerable to **redox** reactions:

- **Oxidizing agents** (like H₂O₂) can modify specific residues, affecting function.
   
- **Reducing agents** (like DTT or β-mercaptoethanol) break **disulfide bonds**, unfolding tertiary structures and destabilizing the protein.

---

## 6. **Reaction with Heavy Metals**

**Lead (Pb²⁺), mercury (Hg²⁺)** and other heavy metal ions bind to **sulfhydryl (-SH)** or **carboxyl (-COOH)** groups, causing **irreversible denaturation**. This is why heavy metal poisoning often affects proteins and enzymes first—it’s molecular sabotage.

---

## 7. **Deamination**

This is the metabolic removal of an amino acid’s **–NH₂ group**, which becomes **ammonia (NH₃)**. Deamination is a critical first step in **amino acid catabolism**, making way for energy production or urea synthesis.

---

## 8. **Decarboxylation**

Here, the **carboxyl group (–COOH)** is removed as **carbon dioxide (CO₂)**, converting the amino acid into an **amine**. Some of these amines (like **histamine**, from histidine) are powerful **neurotransmitters or signaling molecules**.

---

## 9. **Disulfide Bond Formation**

Two **cysteine residues** can oxidize to form a **disulfide bond (–S–S–)**, creating a **cystine bridge**. This stabilizes **tertiary and quaternary** structures, especially in extracellular proteins. Think of it as a molecular safety pin.

---

## 10. **Xanthoproteic Reaction**

Aromatic amino acids (like **tyrosine** and **tryptophan**) react with **nitric acid** to form **yellow-colored nitro derivatives**. When made alkaline, the solution shifts to **orange**. This classic reaction confirms the presence of aromatic side chains in a protein sample.

---

## 11. **Biuret Reaction (Biuret Test)**

In **alkaline conditions**, proteins react with **copper ions (Cu²⁺)** to form a **violet-colored complex**. The intensity of the color correlates with the **number of peptide bonds**—making this a go-to test for estimating **total protein content**.

---

## 12. **Ninhydrin Reaction (Ninhydrin Test)**

Free **amino groups** react with **ninhydrin** to produce a deep **blue/purple color** known as **Ruhemann’s purple**. This is one of the most sensitive and widely used methods for detecting **amino acids and small peptides**.

# Changes in Protein during Food Processing 

## 🔥 Denaturation by Heat, pH, or Mechanical Action

When proteins are exposed to **high heat**, **extreme pH**, or **mechanical shear**, they **unfold**—losing their natural 3D structure. This process, called **denaturation**, disrupts hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions, leading to **coagulation**: proteins clump, lose solubility, and become functionally inactive.  
Think: boiling an egg, frothing milk, or acid-curdled cheese.

---

## 🍞 Maillard Reaction (Protein–Sugar Interaction)

This is the flavorful magic behind **browned food**. When **reducing sugars** react with amino acids (especially **lysine or arginine**) during cooking, it triggers a cascade that creates **melanoidins**—the brown pigments that add **complex aroma, flavor, and color** to grilled meat, bread crust, roasted coffee, and more. It’s non-enzymatic, delicious, and one of food science’s favorite chemical reactions.

---

## 🧂 Enzymatic Hydrolysis (Proteolysis)

Proteins are broken down into **smaller peptides and free amino acids** by **proteases** like pepsin, trypsin, and chymotrypsin. This process is central to **digestion**, but also used in food processing—like **tenderizing meat**, improving **soy digestibility**, or producing **protein hydrolysates** in infant formula or sports supplements.

---

## 🧼 Emulsifying Properties

Proteins act as natural **emulsifiers** by settling at the **oil–water interface**, lowering surface tension and stabilizing emulsions. This is why proteins like **whey**, **egg whites**, or **soy** are essential in salad dressings, sauces, dairy products, and baked goods. Their amphiphilic nature (having both water-loving and fat-loving parts) makes them ideal for holding mixtures together.

---

## 🫧 Foaming Properties

When proteins unfold and align around **air bubbles**, they create **foams**—think of **meringues**, **whipped cream**, or **mousses**. The protein film stabilizes the air pockets, giving structure and lightness. Some proteins, like egg albumin, excel at this.

---

## 🧊 Gel Formation

Under heat or enzymatic action (e.g., **transglutaminase**), proteins denature and **aggregate**, forming 3D **gel networks**. This property is widely used to create textures in processed meats, custards, yogurt, or plant-based meat analogues. The result is a firm yet flexible matrix that retains shape and water.

---

## 💧 Water-Holding Capacity

Denatured or gelled proteins can **retain water** within their structure, which improves **juiciness**, **mouthfeel**, and **shelf life**. It’s especially important in meat products, dairy, and plant-based alternatives, where water retention affects both **texture and volume**.

---

## 🔗 Protein Cross-Linking

Cross-links between protein chains, either through **disulfide bonds** (between cysteine residues) or **enzyme-mediated bonds** (e.g., via transglutaminase), enhance structural integrity. This improves **firmness**, **elasticity**, and **thermal stability**—critical for cheeses, surimi, and even gluten-free baked goods.

---

## 🍞 Interaction with Lipids & Polysaccharides

Proteins form functional complexes with **fats and carbohydrates**, which help stabilize **emulsions**, **foams**, and **gels**. These interactions enhance **nutrient delivery**, modify texture, and improve the physical properties of food—especially in processed or plant-based products.

---

## 🧩 Aggregation & Coagulation

When denatured proteins cluster, they form **aggregates**—visible in foods like **scrambled eggs**, **yogurt curds**, or **tofu**. This structural transformation is often triggered by **heat, acid, or enzymes** and results in **insoluble, semi-solid structures** that define texture.

---

## 🧪 Solubility Changes with Processing

Protein **solubility** is highly sensitive to **processing conditions**:

- **Lowest** at their **isoelectric point** (where net charge = 0)
- **Higher** when they carry net positive or negative charge
- **Decreased** after aggregation, heat, or cross-linking

This shift affects **mixability, texture, and functionality** in both food and pharmaceutical formulations.

## Protein Quality and Compostion Analysis

### 1. 📊 **Amino Acid Profiling** (HPLC, GC-MS)

**What it does:**  
Breaks proteins down into **individual amino acids**, which are then separated and quantified. This is usually done using **HPLC** (with derivatization before or after the column) or **GC-MS** for volatile derivatives.

**Why it matters:**  
Gives you a precise amino acid composition — essential for checking protein purity, nutritional quality, or verifying formulations.

---

### 2. 🧪 **SDS-PAGE** (Electrophoresis)

**What it does:**  
Proteins are denatured and coated with SDS (giving them a uniform negative charge), then loaded into a gel where **they’re separated by size**. Smaller proteins move faster.

**Why it matters:**  
Quickly shows **protein size, purity, and complexity**. Great for comparing samples, checking contamination, or prepping for further analysis.

---

### 3. 🧭 **Isoelectric Focusing (IEF)**

**What it does:**  
Proteins are separated in a gel with a **fixed pH gradient**. Each protein stops moving when it reaches its **isoelectric point (pI)** — the pH where it carries no net charge.

**Why it matters:**  
Powerful for spotting **protein isoforms**, subtle charge variants, and **post-translational modifications**.

---

### 4. 🔍 **Chromatography Techniques**

- **Size-Exclusion Chromatography (SEC):**  
    Separates proteins by size — larger proteins elute first. Perfect for analyzing **aggregation, folding, and oligomerization**.
    
- **Ion-Exchange Chromatography (IEX):**  
    Separates proteins by charge via interaction with charged resin beads. Great for **purification and charge profiling**.
