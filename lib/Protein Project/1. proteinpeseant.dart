Don’t worry, you’re not alone. 
Here, we’ll teach you what protein is, why it matters, and how not to embarrass yourself in front of a biology student. 
No complex terms, just simple stuff with occasional sarcasm. 
Let’s begin your journey from peasant to… slightly less peasant.

# Basic Information 

In this section you'll get to know what protein is and some basic information you might have already known. If not, you're welcome to go through this page. Even if you've known these information already there is nothing wrong with 3 minutes quick revision. Let's dive in.

- **What is Protein?**  
    Protein is a nutrient your body needs to grow, stay strong, and stay healthy. It's found in foods like eggs, meat, beans, and nuts.
    
- **Why Do We Need Protein?**  
    Protein helps build your muscles, skin, hair, and even tiny parts inside your body like cells and enzymes.
    
- **Made of Amino Acids**  
    Proteins are made of smaller parts called **amino acids**—like how words are made of letters. Your body uses 20 types of amino acids to build proteins.
    
- **Some Amino Acids Come from Food**  
    Your body can make some amino acids, but 9 of them must come from the food you eat. That’s why eating enough protein-rich food is important.
    
- **Protein is in Many Foods**  
    You can find protein in animal foods (like chicken, fish, eggs, milk) and plant foods (like beans, lentils, tofu, nuts, and seeds).
    
- **Not Stored Like Fat or Sugar**  
    Your body doesn’t store protein for later use like it does with fat or sugar. That means you need to eat protein regularly.
    
- **Everyone Needs It—But How Much?**  
    Everyone needs protein, but the amount depends on your age, size, and activity. On average, most people need about 50–60 grams a day.
    
- **Too Little or Too Much Can Be a Problem**  
    Not enough protein can make you feel weak or make it harder for your body to heal. Too much over time might not be good for your kidneys.

# Nutritional Importance

Now you've came to know about some basic information about protein. 
You now know what Protein is, what is is made up of and more basics. You are already ahead of 40% of the population (trust me bro...)
Now you are ready to learn about the Nutritional importance of Protein, Requirements for each person and etc.

But it is not complicated. It would be the easiest thing you'll encounter this day (or may not)
So let's dive in.
## Requirements for Different Age Groups

Protein Requirement differs from each age group people. Your protein requirements and your parents protein requriements are entirely different. This is due to several factors like activity level, age, gender and etc. Now let's talk about age.

### 🍼 Infant (0–1 year)

**1.5–2.0 g/kg/day** – Essential for rapid growth, brain development, and building organs and tissues at the fastest pace in life
![](assets/protein/IMG-20250705203707770.jpg)

---

### 🧒 Children (1–12 years)

**0.85–1.0 g/kg/day** – Supports steady physical growth, learning milestones, and development of muscles, bones, and immunity .

![](assets/protein/IMG-20250705203722626.jpg)

---

### 👦 Young Adults / Adolescents (13–18 years)

**0.85–1.0 g/kg/day** – Meets demands of growth spurts, hormone shifts, and building strength during rapid teenage development .

![](assets/protein/IMG-20250705203740602.jpg)

---

### 👩‍🦳 Adults (19–70 years)

**0.75–0.83 g/kg/day** – Maintains body tissues, enzymes, and immune functions in a steady-state, non-growing phase .

![](assets/protein/IMG-20250705203751295.jpg)

---

### 👵 Elderly People (70+ years)

**1.0–1.2 g/kg/day** – Helps prevent muscle wasting (sarcopenia), strengthens bones, and enhances recovery and immunity in aging bodies .

## Requirements for Different Needs

Let's talk about the othe factor which is activity level and your personal goals. 

If you are hitting the gym and want your biceps to be like HE-MAN or THOR, you should eat more protein than your friend who is just chilling in his room. 

It's because protein requirement differs according to your personal goals and activity levels. Let's get to know what your protein requirement is.

### ⚖️ **Maintenance (Sedentary / General Adults)**

**Recommended: 0.8–1.0 g of protein per kg of body weight per day**

This is the **minimum required to keep your body running smoothly** when you're not physically active.

✅ **Why?**

1. Your body constantly breaks down and rebuilds tissues—even when you're just sitting—so protein is needed to **repair cells, maintain immunity, and support organ function**.
2. Without enough protein, your **hair, nails, skin, and muscles** might weaken over time, even if you’re not exercising.

---

### 🏃 **Athletes (Active Individuals)**

**Recommended: 1.2–2.0 g/kg/day**

Athletes—whether runners, dancers, or yoga-lovers—stress their muscles more than sedentary folks, so they need **extra protein to recover and adapt**.

✅ **Why?**

1. Protein helps **rebuild muscle fibers** damaged during workouts and improves endurance over time.

2. More protein = **less muscle soreness, better stamina**, and improved athletic performance.

![](assets/protein/IMG-20250705203830865.jpg)

---

### 💪 **Muscle Building (Strength / Power Training)**

**Recommended: 1.6–2.2 g/kg/day**

If your goal is to look like **He-Man, Thor, or a Greek statue**, you need high protein to **maximize muscle growth** and **reduce fat**.

✅ **Why?**

1. During weight training, your muscles experience tiny tears—protein helps **repair and grow them bigger and stronger**.
    
2. When you're eating in a calorie deficit to lose fat, **higher protein protects muscle mass** and keeps your metabolism from dropping.

# Health Benefits

So you now know about the Different Protein requirement needs for each people you know by now.

If not, just read the previous topic one more time bro, it's not even that hard.

Anyway, now you are ready to know about the various health benefits your body gains due to consumption of protein.

If you ask anyone about protein, they will tell you that PROTEIN IS MUSCLE AND IMMUNITY.

But apart from that there are many health benefits you are gaining by eating Protein.

Let's see them one at a time.

## 15 Health Benefits of Protein

1. **Supports Muscle Growth & Repair**  
    Protein helps your body fix and build muscles — especially after exercise, injury, or even daily wear and tear.  
    Think of it as the construction crew for your muscles.
  
2. **Enhances Immune Function**  
    Your body uses protein to build cells that fight off germs, viruses, and infections.  
    Without enough protein, your body can’t defend itself properly.
   
3. **Increases Satiety & Aids Weight Loss**  
    Protein keeps you feeling full longer, which can stop you from overeating or snacking all day.  
    It helps you eat less without feeling like you're starving.
    
4. **Promotes Healthy Aging**  
    As we age, we naturally lose muscle — protein slows that down and helps you stay stronger for longer.  
    It’s like age-proofing your muscles.
    
5. **Improves Blood Sugar Control**  
    Protein slows down how quickly sugar enters your blood after eating.  
    That means fewer energy crashes and better sugar control — especially for diabetics.
    
6. **Boosts Bone Health**  
    Protein isn’t just for muscles — it also supports stronger bones by helping them rebuild and stay dense.  
    This reduces the risk of fractures as you age.
    

7. **Supports Cardiovascular Health**  
    Eating enough protein can lower bad fats in your blood and keep your heart working smoothly.  
    Yes, your heart is a muscle too!
    
8. **Speeds Tissue Healing**  
    Got a cut or just had surgery? Protein helps rebuild your skin and tissues faster.  
    It’s your body’s repair toolkit.
    
9. **Has Antioxidant Properties**  
    Some amino acids in protein help your body make glutathione — your cell’s natural defense shield.  
    It protects you from stress, pollution, and toxins.
    
10. **Anti-Cancer Potential**  
    Some proteins (like whey) support your immune system and may help fight off abnormal cell growth.  
    Not a cure, but definitely a helper.
    
11. **Antimicrobial & Antiviral Effects**  
    Proteins like lactoferrin act like tiny bodyguards — stopping bacteria and viruses before they cause harm.  
    Think of them as part of your internal defense squad.
    
12. **Enhances Athletic Performance**  
    Protein helps your body recover after intense training and keeps your energy systems running well.  
    Athletes use it to stay strong and bounce back faster.

13. **Beneficial in Cancer Cachexia**  
    People with cancer often lose weight and muscle fast — protein can help slow that down.  
    It’s essential for keeping strength during illness.
    
14. **Supports Infant Growth & Development**  
    Babies need high-quality protein to grow properly in their early months and years.  
    That’s why it’s a key part of breast milk and baby formula.
    
15. **Strengthens Skin, Hair & Joints**  
    Protein provides ingredients for collagen — which keeps your skin firm, hair strong, and joints flexible.  
    It’s beauty and mobility, from the inside out.

# Deficiency Diseases

When your body doesn’t get enough protein, especially for long periods, it can lead to serious health problems. Protein is essential for building muscles, repairing tissues, supporting immunity, and keeping body systems running. A lack of it can result in conditions like **kwashiorkor** and **marasmus**, which mostly affect children in areas with food insecurity. These diseases are different but both show how critical protein is for survival and healthy growth.
## Kwashirokar
Kwashiorkor is caused by **severe protein deficiency**, even when a child is eating enough calories (usually from carbohydrates like rice or maize). It most often appears in children around **1.5 to 3 years old**, especially after they’re weaned off breast milk onto low-protein diets.

![](assets/protein/IMG-20250705203325959.png)

Key symptoms include:

- **Swelling (edema)** in the legs, feet, and belly due to low blood protein (albumin), which causes fluid leakage.
- A **puffy face**, **thin and brittle hair**, **flaky or patchy skin**, and a **fatty liver**.
- The child may seem plump from fluid retention, but is actually severely malnourished.
- They often have **diarrhea**, extreme **fatigue**, **irritability**, and a **weakened immune system**, which increases the risk of infections.
- Developmental delays and **slowed mental and physical growth** are common.
- Without treatment, kwashiorkor can be **fatal**.

**Treatment** involves medical stabilization, followed by gradual introduction of **protein-rich foods**, vitamins, and minerals.
## Marasmus
Marasmus is caused by a **combined deficiency of both protein and calories**, leading to extreme energy and nutrient shortage. It mainly affects **infants under 1 year old**, especially when they’re not breastfed or weaned too early without adequate nutrition.

![](assets/protein/IMG-20250705203407806.png)

Key signs include:

- A **“skin and bones” appearance**, with **visible ribs**, **sunken eyes**, and **very little fat or muscle**.
- **Severe weight loss**, **dry and wrinkled skin**, and **loose folds of skin**.
- No swelling (edema) like in kwashiorkor — the child looks extremely thin and wasted.
- **Constant hunger**, **low energy**, frequent **diarrhea**, and high **infection risk**.   
- Growth is **severely stunted**, and mental development may also suffer.
- Marasmus can also lead to **death** if not treated promptly.

**Treatment** focuses on careful refeeding with **energy-rich and protein-rich foods**, hydration, and treating infections.
